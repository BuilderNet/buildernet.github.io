BuilderNet is a work in progress. We intend to incrementally upgrade the network be more permissionless, distributed, and resilient -- and we welcome collaboration and input throughout this process.

## Goals

**Permissionlessness**: Anyone must be able to operate and use BuilderNet. This will lower the barrier for new parties to enter the network and remove single points of failure, making it more resilient to capture and faults.

**Maximum participation**: BuilderNet should not just *allow* anyone to participate, it should intentionally maximize the number of parties that contribute to each block. Coordinating across many parties with different skills and locations will increase its resilience and unlock more economically valuable interactions.

**Capture resistance**: Finally, BuilderNet must prevent a few parties from gaining a position of value extraction or control within the network. This will ensure that powerful economic actors cannot capture its governance, censor transactions, or seek rent â€” keeping BuilderNet itself decentralized, so that it can do the same for Ethereum.
