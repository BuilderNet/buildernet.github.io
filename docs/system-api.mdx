title: System API
description: System API provides a basic interface with the TEE system to the operator.
---

[System API](https://github.com/flashbots/system-api) is the primary interface between node operators and the services running inside the TEE instance.

## Goals

1. Basic observability (i.e. startup stages, errors, etc.)
2. Restart services
3. Trigger a graceful reboot
4. Apply configuration

## Code

The service is written in Golang and the code is here: [github.com/flashbots/system-api](https://github.com/flashbots/system-api)

## Key functions

System API provides the following functionality:

- **Event log**: Services inside a TDX instance can record events they want exposed to the operator. Useful to record service startup/shutdown, status, errors, progress updates, etc.
- **Actions**: Ability to execute pre-defined shell commands via API, such as rebooting the instance or restarting the rbuilder service.
- **Configuration**: Ability to upload files to pre-defined destinations.

The API supports [HTTP Basic Auth](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7617) to restrict access, and TLS for secure communication.

Information exposed as logs currently only includes service startup information. This might be expanded over time to include non-sensitive event information, certain metrics, and/or system status details.

## Example usage

The following shell snippet shows the general use of the System API:

#### Example configuration

```toml
[general]
listen_addr = "0.0.0.0:3535"
pipe_file = "pipe.fifo"
pprof = true
log_json = false
log_debug = true

# Maximum number of entries in the log
log_max_entries = 1000

# HTTP Basic Auth
basic_auth_secret_path = "basic-auth-secret.txt" # basic auth is supported if a path is provided
basic_auth_secret_salt = "D;%yL9TS:5PalS/d"      # use a random string for the salt

# HTTP server timeouts
# http_read_timeout_ms = 2500
# http_write_timeout_ms = 2500

# TLS configuration
tls_enabled = true
tls_create_if_missing = true
tls_cert_hosts = ["localhost", ""]
tls_cert_path = "cert.pem"
tls_key_path = "key.pem"

[actions]
echo_test = "echo test"
# reboot = "reboot"
# rbuilder_restart = "/etc/init.d/rbuilder restart"
# rbuilder_stop = "/etc/init.d/rbuilder stop"

[file_uploads]
testfile = "/tmp/testfile.txt"
```

#### Example usage

```bash
# Start the API server
$ make run

# Add events
$ echo "hello world" > pipe.fifo
$ curl localhost:3535/api/v1/new_event?message=this+is+a+test

# Execute actions
$ curl -v localhost:3535/api/v1/actions/echo_test

# Upload files
$ curl -v -X POST -d "@README.md" localhost:3535/api/v1/file-upload/testfile

# Get event log
$ curl localhost:3535/logs
2024-11-05T22:03:23Z     hello world
2024-11-05T22:03:26Z     this is a test
2024-11-05T22:03:29Z     [system-api] executing action: echo_test = echo test
2024-11-05T22:03:29Z     [system-api] executing action success: echo_test = echo test
2024-11-05T22:03:31Z     [system-api] file upload: testfile = /tmp/testfile.txt
2024-11-05T22:03:31Z     [system-api] file upload success: testfile = /tmp/testfile.txt - content: 1991 bytes
```
